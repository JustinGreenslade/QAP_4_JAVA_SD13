## Medication Tracking System - QAP 4 Java Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple Java application that manages medication data using two ways to save and read information

- Saving Drug data to a text file
- Saving Patient data in a PostgreSQL database

The program allows users to add, edit, delete, and view records through a menu interfaces. It demonstrates basic skills in file handling, JDBC database connection, and user interaction with console input.

## How It Went

Overall, I found the project challenging but very helpful for understanding how to save data both in files and databases. The file handling part was straightforward, but connecting and working with the database using JDBC took more time to get right(Jordans session really helped).

I spent about 18 hours completing the project, including coding, testing, and fixing errors. I used online resources, class lectures, and YouTube. I also asked my instructor a few questions to confirm requirements.

## Assessment Questions

1. **How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?**

- Drug.java: 1 hour
- Patient.java: 1 hour
- FileHandler.java: 3 hours
- DatabaseHandler.java: 2 hours
- Database operations in FileHandler.java: 3 hours
- Menu.java: 6 hours
- Main.java : 1+ hour
- Testing and Debugging: 1 hour

2. **What online resources did you use?**

   - Class lectures and notes
   - YouTube tutorials on JDBC and file handling
   - Stack Overflow for troubleshooting specific errors
   - Final review with fellow classmate ( Joseph Gallant)

3. **Did you get help from any classmates?**

   - No not help, However a final review to compare and check for errors

4. **Did you ask for help from an instructor?**

   - Yes, during TA session to properly set up connection details(Was great review).

5. **Rate the difficulty of each problem and your confidence in solving similar problems in the future:**
   - File handling (reading/writing text): Difficulty 3/5, confident to do again.
   - Database handling (JDBC with PostgreSQL): Difficulty 4/5, somewhat confident but would review docs again.
   - Menu and input validation: Difficulty 2/5, I enjoy organizing and making it feel clean and clear.
